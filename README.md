WordPress-Backbone-League-App
=============================

WordPress/Backbone League App

Simple App that allows you to create a league, add players and record game results. The app will display a league table for the results.

NOTE - A bit of an experiment. Very early stages really (and I probably won't take it any further)

The front end of the app is built in Backbone.js. This interacts with an api built on WordPress.


Issues...

* Make sure you have set some sort of pretty permalinks.
* Tries to create term meta table when before WP is installed - may need to comment out.
