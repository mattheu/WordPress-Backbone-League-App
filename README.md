=============================

WordPress/Backbone League App


Issues...

* Make sure you have set some sort of pretty permalinks.
* HM Core Term Meta doesn't seem to be working right -
    * Tries to create term meta table when before WP is installed - may need to comment out.
    * Doesn't work! Only today so should be a simple fix. I hardcoded 'rounds' to 2 so you cannot change this but it works.
